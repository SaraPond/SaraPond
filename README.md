"Study something you love, and it will becomes an opportunity rather than a chore"

Hi there! My name is Sara, and I'm a new Junior Java Developer with big dreams of becoming a Front-End Developer. I may not have any professional experience (yet!), but I've spent over 500 hours honing my skills in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a full-stack course. Currently, I'm studying for another 200 hours to master the art of front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
